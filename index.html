      <h1>Wesley Ruedebusch</h1>
  
      <p>
        I was raised to treat others how you would like to be treated. I try to
        be nice to everyone. I value others opinions especially when working on
        projects. Every problem may have alternate solutions. I like to think I
        am good at working with people on that.

      <h4>My Skills</h4>

      <P>
        Growing up in Wapakoneta,OH you learn a lot of things. I know how to
        run, a bobcat, mig weld, and how to cook. Bailing hay in the summer
        could earn you some quick cash but I spent my time as a lifeguard. I
        learned communication skills, showing respect and what hard work really
        was. I also have some tech skills and hobbies. Check it out!
      </P>
